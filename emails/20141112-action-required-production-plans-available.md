Hi,

You're receiving this email because [Blower.io (the SMS addon)](https://addons.heroku.com/blowerio) is installed on your **{{app_name}}**
Heroku app.

We'd like to thank you for all of your support over the previous few months while we've
worked to get our product into production on the Heroku Add-ons Marketplace. That day
finally arrived a couple of weeks ago and we're excited to have officially launched all
of our production plans. That means that the beta/test plan you currently have installed
on your app named **{{app_name}}** will be going away soon.

We'll continue to provide access and service to you installed add-on for the remainder of
this year, but on the 31st of December 2014 the plan you're on will disappear. If you
continue to need access to SMS within you app we recommend you
[upgrade to a production plan](https://addons.heroku.com/blowerio) as soon as possible to
ensure you suffer no interruption to you service.

Thank you again for all of your support,

The Blower.io team
